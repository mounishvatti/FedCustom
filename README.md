## Introduction

Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that enables model training across multiple devices or servers holding local data samples without exchanging them. This technique offers privacy benefits as it allows training models without centralizing data. 

Traditional machine learning techniques, on the other hand, typically involve centralizing data on a single server or location for training. This approach may raise privacy concerns and scalability issues, especially when dealing with large datasets or sensitive information.

In this repository, we delve into implementing Federated Learning using the Flower framework and compare its performance with traditional machine learning techniques. 

## Comparison

| Feature               | Traditional ML | Federated Learning |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Data Centralization   | Centralized    | Decentralized      |
| Privacy               | Concerns        | Enhanced           |
| Scalability          | Limited        | Improved           |
| Communication Overhead| High           | Low                |
| Data Dependency       | High           | Low                |
